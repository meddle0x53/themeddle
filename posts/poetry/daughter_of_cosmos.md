# Daughter Of Cosmos

  <br />
  My daughter of darkness,
  <br />
  my cosmic dream, my all,
  <br />
  innocence, empty vessel,
  <br />
  inheritance of a void soul.
  <br />
  <br />
  Your future may be bleak,
  <br />
  but I’ll give you my light,
  <br />
  your own path to seek,
  <br />
  in the end of the night.
  <br />
  <br />
  Be the sun of the cold dawn,
  <br />
  or a supernova or a blackhole,
  <br />
  your destiny is not yet drawn,
  <br />
  just carry my burnt coal.
  <br />
  <br />
  Be free, but not like me, more,
  <br />
  your guidance is in your hands,
  <br />
  ambitions of parents, are so sore,
  <br />
  not your pain to carry in the end.
  <br />
  <br />
  My flower of darkness, my dahlia,
  <br />
  my daughter of cosmos, my little all,
  <br />
  I’ll be with you, always and forever,
  <br />
  you are the sunrise, I’m the nightfall.
